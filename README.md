# Music Player

This app plays Lo-fi music. I have built this app so I have something to listen to when Im working on current projects. No need for spotify. 
This app has all the functionality of a music player. Play, Pause, Next, Previous, Shuffle and Repeat.
This is built using Javascript, React, HTML, SASS and is live and hosted on Netlifty
